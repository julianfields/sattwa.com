        Guatama Buddha made a promise to his disciples that for nine years he would meditate without sleeping.  Five years later after reaching a town named Canton, he became tired while sitting in front of a wall for meditation.  Inspired by an intervention of Mother Nature,  he involuntarily chewed a few leaves of a nearby tree and immediately felt a feeling of well being and revitalization.

        Immensely pleased,  he collected the leaves of that tree, Camellia Sinesis, that helped him to keep up his promise of meditating for nine years without sleep.  He later moved towards the east and the Buddhist Monks there in Japan received those Chai Tea leaves from Siidhartha and started consuming Chai made out of those leaves to keep them alert during their meditation.

        Fast forward several thousand years to 1995. A small group of friends in the foothills of the oregon Coastal range were playing with different formulas of chai.  Sitting around enjoying their mornings with conversation and chai.  A friend mentioned they should sell their chai and their began the journey of Sattwa Chai.  

        At the time “chai tea”, and masala chai, which origins are in indai was not well known in the U.S.  Several companies began producing different versions of chai.  Many saw chai as a fad or product that would simply be here one day and gone the next.  We now know this was not the case.  Chai is loved across the country, it can be found a nearly every coffee shop and cafe and in stores all over.

        The word Sattwa

        1.  Purity, light, lightness.

        When the quality of sattva is predominant or increasing in a person, there will be certain characteristics. You will see an increase of happiness, knowledge, light, purity, peace and harmony.

        To have a sattvic diet, one should try to eat as much as possible foods which are fresh, ripe, nutritious and tasty. Some examples of sattvic foods are milk, fruit, dal, and almonds, and there are many more.
