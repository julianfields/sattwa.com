We heard once that Chai is the second most commonly used word in the world, behind “okay.”   

Chai means tea, and tea is a universal beverage.  When we talk in this country about a Chai 

Tea Latte, we are being redundant.    More accurately we would say Chai Latte.  Tea with milk.

To be even more accurate we would say Masala Chai Latte.  Masala means spices.  Not every 

culture puts spices Chai (tea). 

In 1995 Chai was a foreign beverage in the US market.  So, many of us were educating, and the 

education took many different directions just as the Chai products took diverse directions.  

The interesting thing about Chai is that it can be made in many different ways.  In India, each 

family has its own recipe, and those can vary dramatically from family to family and region to 

region.    

Not too many companies have chosen to formulate and market a traditional chai with tea leaves 

and dry specially ground spices.   For Sattwa, that was our starting point in formulation. 

However,  to compete in the marketplace we were required to formulate a Chai concentrate that 

could be steamed quickly with milk by the barista to produce a Chai Latte.

Sattwa Sun, our traditional chai - a dry mix blend of organic tea leaves and organic spices - is 

still our favorite.  We have a solid number of customers who continue to use this product today 

in their coffee shops, bakeries, and tea houses.  These are the ones who value the art of 

brewing chai, offering a cup rich in the tradition of India.  

We can’t count how many different varieties of Chai products are now in the marketplace.  

Some of them we would probably not call Chai at all.  But we have a particular perspective that 

honors the tradition from the roots in India.   When we formulated our Chai Concentrate, we 

kept as much of that tradition alive as possible.  That’s why we microbrew and allow the spices 

to sit in the kettle for a good stretch, yielding their magic before we add the tea.  

Let’s raise our cups for a toast to this time honored tradition from India and its integration into 

the American Market in all its forms.
