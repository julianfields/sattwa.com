        # Our Story

         Sattwa Chai, one of the pioneering companies in the United States, was born in 1995 out of a desire to support our extended family and our community and out of a deep conecction with India where chai (black tea) with spices has it origns.
         Our first chai product was a dry mix blend of spices and black tea, a traditional chai we call Sattwa Sun.  The American market was responding most favorably to a liquid chai concentrate that could be steamed up by baristas and called a 
         "chai tea latte."  Accordingly, Sattwa Chai created a premium concentrate that we brew with care using real tea leaves and spices.
         
         During the late 90's Sattwa Chai was continuing to grow alongside the Organic and Fair Trade movement, both which were resonant with our values.  the internet and accesss to information about the world and our ways of living in it as fueling
         our desire to understand more about how we could play our part to enable sustainability and to promote the care and well being of all peoples.
         
         Sattwa Chai converted to using all organic materials and in 2004 began to purchase Fair Trade Tea.  To pay a premium for tea is to support the well being of the tea workers in regard to wages, health care, education, and child labor.  Our 
         number one core value reads.  "loving and caring for our team and our global family comes first."
         
         Sattwa Chai is unique in the marketplace.  We are a famliy owned, second generation company, dedicated to producing an authentic quality product backed by a genuine caring for people and the environment.  We call on our spiritual understanding
         and our belief in basic human value to manage our company and foster our relationships.
