Because our daughter Angela’s 25th birthday is tomorrow, I have been reflecting on what it has meant to us to have a family owned business.  When we launched Sattwa Chai in 1995, we 
were a community of 6 adults and 4 children.  The youngest child was 3; the oldest 2 were 13.  From the very beginning we worked out of our home, creating a space in what was otherwise a three car garage.  Five of us had “work stations” lined up in a row in what had previously been an exercise area of the garage.  Faye was the main mother at that time, with the rest of us engaged dynamically in the development of the Sattwa Chai business.

Often, the kids were involved in putting stickers on packages and assisting with other 
appropriate projects.  They grew up hearing about the business and our growing understanding 
of business principles and of our values in doing business.  Those values of unity and caring for each other and our world around us, have become the foundation upon which they live their adult lives.

Julian, our eldest, came to work for Sattwa Chai in 2009.  He has been a dynamic member of 
the team, offering his skills at the order desk, in customer service, and in marketing.  His gifts are with people - team building and problem solving.  He works part time now as he prepares for a new endeavor in the computer/tech world as a web developer and designer.    Angela, with her radiant spirit and gifted way with people, is working in the service industry in Portland.  She may move in the direction of life coaching which would utilize those people skills in an impactful way for others.  Nathan, our youngest and 22, is a gifted musician.  He continues to live at home which we all enjoy, though he has plans to move to LA as soon as the opportunity arises.  He has signed a contract with a sound design company out of LA, has provided a library of sounds, and looks forward this month to the launch of that body of work.

Having a family owned business has meant and means that we are able to support one another 
as we all grow and change.  We are able to create a vision and to manage that vision with our own values as the guiding hand.  Many times we entertained the possibility of creating 
partnership; yet, we found time and time again, that we were best suited to managing Sattwa 
Chai as a private entity.   As in all things, there is an up side and a down side to all management styles.  The bottom line for us:  we are grateful for the opportunity to manage a business that includes our immediate family and extended family; that we have the means to offer support where it is needed; and that we have children who appreciate the life and support they have been given.  They give their love without reserve.  We are fortunate indeed.
