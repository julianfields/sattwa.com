We are in our 20th year of business, manufacturing and selling Sattwa Chai to locations all over the US and Canada.  Fifteen years ago Chai was unknown.  Anyone who had visited an ashram in India or even here in the US knew about Chai, but that was a minority population.    Part of our mission in the early years was to educate, to demonstrate, and to talk, talk, talk  about this new, intriguing beverage.   Many said it would be a fad and would fade out before long.  Obviously, this has not been the case.  Chai is it’s own category within the Specialty Coffee and Tea umbrella with annual revenue in the millions of dollars.
 
In 1995 Sattwa chai was one of several companies seeking to introduce this new beverage and category of tea.  We are the only one remaining with its original founders and managers at the helm.    While we entertained bringing in investment capital and other “experts” , we were unwilling to adapt our values to other more aggressive modes of doing business or to products of less quality or lacking the Chai tradition as we viewed it.  
 
As we look back over the years we feel gratitude for the courage to start our business, and gratitude for our major competitor Oregon Chai who was able, with capital and lively expertise on their team, to blast into the marketplace, making the category known.   We also have gratitude for the gift of our team’s tenacity to stay present through the roller coaster ride of entrepreneurship.  Riding the cycles of business ups and downs is not for the faint of heart.
We have survived the lows, summoning deeper reserves of acceptance.  We have celebrated the highs with deeper knowledge of the entire cycle.   Some of the lows and highs were lower and higher than others, but we have come to know the inevitable duality.  
 
Doing business as Sattwa Chai has taught us more equanimity and more humility. It has taught us to do our best and to let go of the fruits of our actions.  It has taught us to have compassion for all entrepreneurs who brave manifesting their dreams of having success in their own enterprise.    We are still learning!
