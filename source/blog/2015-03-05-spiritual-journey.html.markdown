Sattwa of Sattwa Chai is a sanskrit word meaning truth, purity, balance of nature.  This name for our company emerged out of a love of Vedic knowledge and of Mother India.  Our spiritual journeys have led us again and again to this ancient knowledge as the basis for our understanding about life and the nature of existence.    
 

We have met and been blessed by many masters and teachers from India, all of whom have found their way into our hearts.  Ammachi, the now great world teacher and embodiment of unconditional love and compassion, who we call our CEO.  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi who initiated our partner David into meditation in the 1980â€™s.  Ramesh Balsekar, teacher of Advaita, who we all visited in Mumbai again and again, sitting in his apartment day after day, letting the teachings be a breeze through our hungry minds.  
 
We have also met teachers in the West, our own beautiful country, who have brought the knowledge of Advaita and Vedanta into our living rooms.  
 
Our spiritual journey has spread beyond India to South America and the indigenous tribes of the Amazon Basin.  Here we have interfaced primarily with the Shapibo Tribe. Their deep connection with the plant kingdom has offered new perspectives and experiences of healing mind, body, and spirit.
 
And our spiritual journey is our day to day life and the integration of the knowledge that has been flowing to us over these past 20 years. As we have continued to manage Sattwa Chai, we have appreciated more and more the beauty of our company and the possibility of doing business in a way that suits our nature and communicates a message of connection and caring.
